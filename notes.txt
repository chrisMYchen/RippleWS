Conner mack... ripple solutiosn team

how banks integrate with ripple -->

built on top of inner ledger protocol

ripple consensus layer --> blockchain distributed ledger

new protocol --> inner ledger protocol , people don't like publicly available, everyone agree on one blockchain tech is hard
  not everyone agree on same ledger, provide a different way for differnet ledgers to communicate, private ,not publicly share transactions
    not distributed, easier to scale,

product built on ripple consensus, not built on inner ledger protocol
  getting good reception from banks and work to continue building on that

ripple really focused on building protocol vs an actual use case

  bitcoin issues, lack of governance , scalability issues
  get people to agree

tech companies /startups addressing a very basic problem
  something marginally better

reinvent how money moves, huge risk!! huge opportunity to change how things are done.

- being open to new stuff, huge variety things to do things outside, learn new languages! new paradigms!
